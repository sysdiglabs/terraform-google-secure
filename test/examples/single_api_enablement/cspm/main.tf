/*
This terraform file is intended to enable the GCP APIs needed for CSPM feature within a single project onboarding.
It will create a google_project_service resource per each service enabled within the GCP project.
The APIs needed for the CSPM feature are listed below:
  - Security Token Service API
  - Cloud Asset API
  - Cloud Identity API
  - Admin SDK API
In addition, since CSPM is needed for onboard any GCP project these other APIs are also enabled:
  - Identity and access management API
  - IAM Service Account Credentials API
  - Cloud Resource Manager API

* Note: This do not overwrite any other APIs config that your GCP project has, it will only enabled it if isn't yet.
